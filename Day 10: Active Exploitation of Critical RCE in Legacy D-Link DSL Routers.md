# Alert Title: Active Exploitation of Critical RCE in Legacy D-Link DSL Routers

<br>

## **Description**
Security researchers have identified active exploitation in the wild of a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2026-0625, CVSS 9.3) in multiple legacy D-Link DSL gateway routers that are no longer supported and have reached end-of-life (EoL). <br>
The flaw exists due to improper sanitization of DNS configuration parameters in the dnscfg.cgi endpoint, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands. <br>
Exploitation has been observed since at least November 27, 2025, with evidence captured by the Shadowserver Foundation and reported by VulnCheck. <br>
<br>
Affected models include older firmware variants of the DSL-2640B, DSL-2740R, DSL-2780B, and DSL-526B routers. Because these devices have surpassed their support lifecycle, they will not receive patches, increasing risk if continued in service. Successful exploitation can result in full control of the router, DNS manipulation, traffic interception, malware deployment, and compromise of downstream networks. <br>
<br>
Key risk indicators for detection: <br>
■ Unusual HTTP requests to router CGI endpoints (specifically dnscfg.cgi). <br>
■ Unauthenticated external access to legacy router web interfaces. <br>
■ Remote execution or shell invocation from network perimeter devices. <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>


## **Threats**
■ **Cybercriminal groups leveraging automated scanners/bots**

### **Techniques**
■ **T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application**: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/ <br>
■ **T1068 – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/ <br>
■ **T1547 – Boot or Service Initialization Scripts**: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/  <br>
■ **T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol-Web Protocols**: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/  <br>

<br>

## **Severity**
**High**: Remote unauthenticated code execution on perimeter networking devices poses a significant risk of full network compromise and traffic manipulation, especially in unmanaged or consumer environments..

<br>

## **Detection Type** 
■ Behavioural Detection  <br>
■ TTP‑based  <br>

<br>

## **Data Sources**
### **Microsoft Sentinel**
■ **Microsoft XDR Telemetry**: `DeviceNetworkEvents` `DeviceProcessEvents`

<br>

## **False Positives**
■ Router management activity during authorized configuration <br>
■ Security/monitoring scans accessing CGI endpoints <br>
■ Internal admin scripts modifying DNS settings legitimately <br>

## **KQL Query**

```kusto

let timeframe = 24h;
let LegacyRouters = dynamic([
    "dnscfg.cgi"
]);
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeframe)
| where RemoteUrl has_any (LegacyRouters)
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("svchost.exe", "System") // network perimeter traffic
| extend URLPath = tostring(parse_url(RemoteUrl).Path)
| where URLPath has "dnscfg.cgi"
| summarize
    FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated),
    CountConnections=count()
by DeviceName, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by CountConnections desc
